## Q1

A and B are weighted, undirected graphs. B has the same edges as A, except the weights are increased by 3.

a) Do the minimal spanning trees of A and B always contain the same edges? Justify your answer.
Yes, since all the edeges are increased by 3, therefore, the minimal spanning treeso of graph A will be the same as graph B.
b) Consider the tree of single-source shortest paths from some vertex (e.g. as produced by Dijkstra's algorithm).
Does this tree always contain the same edges in both graphs? Justify your answer.
No, since the shortest path does not 
## Q2

A particular graph is stored as an array of edges, each represented as a pair of vertices.
When a new edge is added, it is placed at the end of the array.
For example: [{2, 3}, {1, 2}, {0, 2}, {0, 1}].

a) What is the time complexity of breadth first search using this representation? Give your answer in terms
of V and E.

b) How can this representation be adjusted to improve the complexity of BFS, while maintaining the same
space complexity?

## Q3

Consider an arbitrary undirected connected graph G.
A graph G\* is constructed by replacing every edge of G with 4 edges and two vertices like this:

```
       G                            G*
                              ------ C ------
                             /               \
A ------------- B     =>    A                 B
                             \               /
                              ------ D ------
```

Is it true that G\* has an Euler cycle?
